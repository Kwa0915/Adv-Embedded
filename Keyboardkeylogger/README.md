### There's been a need in surveillance technology to monitor and record keystrokes on a keyboard. This technology is often used in business to troubleshoot, improve user experience, or monitor employees. It is also used by hackers to monitor activity and obtain personal data, such as passwords or credit card information. 

### We built an embedded system which acts as a keyboard keylogger device. This device can capture keyboard presses from a USB keyboard, decode it, and store it as a memory in a Nexys Video FPGA board. A maximum of 4096 data could be stored in the BRAM. It is able to export all the data in blocks of 1024 and print it to a terminal or Tera Term.
